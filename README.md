# ✨ Creative HTML Lab

A collection of small, creative web projects built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This repo is my personal playground for learning, experimenting, and building fun front-end mini-projects.

---

## 🧪 **What you'll find here**

- 🎨 Small UI experiments & sliders
- 🐱 Cat Thumbslider project with hidden achievement & surprise video
- Simple JavaScript popups, animations, and effects
- Each project in its own folder, easy to open & run

## 🚀 **Why this repo?**

This lab is where I:
- Practice front-end skills
- Try out ideas & learn by building
- Collect creative code snippets & UI patterns
- Build fun, shareable demos

All projects here are intentionally lightweight, vanilla (no frameworks) and focus on **pure HTML, CSS, JS**.
